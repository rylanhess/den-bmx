# âœ… Email Error Fixed!

## What Was Wrong

The error showed:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@react-email/render'
```

**Problem**: Resend requires React Email packages to render HTML emails, but they weren't installed.

## What I Fixed

### 1. Installed Required Packages
```bash
npm install @react-email/render @react-email/components
```

These packages allow Resend to properly render the HTML email templates.

### 2. Fixed Build Warning
Removed an unused error variable in the contact form.

## âœ… Build Status

**Build is now successful!** âœ“
