## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Resend API Key (FREE)

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for free account
3. Verify your email
4. Go to "API Keys" in dashboard
5. Click "Create API Key"
6. Copy the key (starts with `re_`)

### Step 2: Add Environment Variable

Create or edit `.env.local` in your project root:

```bash
# Add this line with your actual API key
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
```

**Important**: The `.env.local` file is already in `.gitignore` - it won't be committed!

### Step 3: Test It

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Visit the contact page
open http://localhost:3000/contact
```

Fill out the form and submit. You should receive an email at hess.rylan@gmail.com!
